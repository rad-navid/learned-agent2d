# Training a Simulated Soccer Agent to Optimize Goal Scoring
In work, combines machine-learning techniques with computational algorithms, we have been able to find the optimal time and best point in the goal to maximize chance of scoring. We have been able to increase agent’s shoot accuracy by a factor of 97.2%.  We have also been able to achieve a more maintainable source code by replacing major part of computational algorithms used to define agent’s shoot action with a more efficient learning model. Moreover, changing computational-intensive algorithms with an extremely fast learning model like logistic regression, agents are now more responsive in the predetermined timeframe of 0.1s.
